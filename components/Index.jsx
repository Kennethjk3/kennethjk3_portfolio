            <h1>A newt?</h1>
            <p>Why do you think that she is a witch? I have to push the pram a lot. Well, how'd you become king, then? But you are dressed as oneâ€¦</p>
            <p>It's only a model. Bloody Peasant! Shut up! Well, how'd you become king, then?</p>
            <h2>Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!</h2>
            <p>Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! He hasn't got shit all over him. Bloody Peasant! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Did you dress her up like this?</li><li>Burn her anyway!</li><li>Well, we did do the nose.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</h3>
            <p>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! What a strange person. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. He hasn't got shit all over him. Well, what do you want?</p>

              <li>A newt?</li><li>What do you mean?</li><li>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</li>

            <p>Well, I didn't vote for you. Who's that then? A newt? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!</p>
            <p>The nose? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
